## Introduction

The purpose of cFreeze is to help corn seed growers understand the potential risk of freeze damage at harvest time. cFreeze calculates the percent occurrence of temperatures below zero degrees Celsius for any day of the year, given the GPS coordinates for a location of interest and the last 30-year historical weather data extracted from Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) closest to that location.  cFreeze also calculates the last day to harvest given certain levels of freeze risk after the summer months (June) in the northern hemisphere (NH).  

To learn more about cFreeze, check the cFreeze webpage which includes this Readme page, References to each of the functions, and and article on how to use it.

## Data

All weather data used by this package is extracted directly from IEM using the apsimx package.  cFreeze uses the minimum temperature (mint) reported by IEM the percentage of days with temperature below 0C or freezing.  No data is stored or kept by the cFreeze package.

To learn more about IEM, follow this link:
https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/


## Requirements

The following package needs to be installed and loaded for cFreeze to be able to extract weather data directly from IEM. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("apsimx") #if not installed already
library(apsimx)
```


## Instalation
cFreeze can be installed directly from its GitHub public repository using the devtools package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("devtools")  #if not installed already
devtools::install.github("gnbltrn/cFreeze/cFreeze")

#Load cFreeze
library(cFreeze)
```


## Basic Demonstration of Funtionality

Once cFreeze is installed and loaded, you can use any of its 5 functions independently: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

#Returns the last day to harvest (after June, NH) with no historical risk of freezing.

#Usage
nofreeze (lon, lat)

#Example
nofreeze(-118.607994, 41.659626)

#Outcome
[1] "Sep-17"
```
