### cFreeze Package

The purpose of cFreeze is to help corn seed growers understand the potential risk of freeze damage at harvest time. cFreeze calculates the percent occurrence of temperatures below zero degree Celsius for any day of the year, given the GPS coordinates for a location of interest and the last 30-year historical weather data extracted from Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) closest to that location.  cFreeze also calculates the last day to harvest given certain levels of freeze risk after the summer months (June) in the northern hemisphere (NH).
